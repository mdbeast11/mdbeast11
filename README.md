The Personal Health Tracker and Activity Recommendation System is a Python-based project aimed at helping users track and improve their daily health metrics. By inputting data such as hours of sleep, water intake, and steps walked, the program will analyze the user's lifestyle and provide personalized recommendations for improving overall health. The goal is to create a tool that motivates users to maintain healthy habits and make incremental improvements based on their specific needs.

ii. Algorithm / Library / Methods:
The project will utilize the following methods and libraries:

Pandas for handling and analyzing user-provided data.
Matplotlib for visualizing health trends, like tracking daily steps or sleep patterns.
A basic rule-based algorithm will be implemented to compare the user's data against health guidelines (e.g., daily hydration, exercise requirements) and recommend improvements. For example, if the user has slept fewer than 7 hours, the system will suggest an earlier bedtime.
Numpy will be used for any necessary numerical computations.
iii. Data Requirements:
The project will require user-inputted data for daily health metrics, including:

Hours of sleep
Water intake (liters)
Physical activity (steps)
Optional data like mood and dietary information
No external datasets are needed, as the application will rely on real-time user inputs.

iv. Expected Outcome:
The final product will be an interactive Python-based system where users can enter their daily health data, and in return, receive personalized recommendations aimed at improving their lifestyle. For instance, the program may recommend increasing water intake or adding more physical activity based on the userâ€™s current metrics. The program will also visualize trends over time, allowing users to see their progress. The expected outcome is a practical tool that promotes healthier habits and aids users in achieving better overall well-being.

This project will serve as an engaging tool for individuals looking to monitor and improve their health in a simple, data-driven manner.
